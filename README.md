# Introduction
This is my `~/.vimrc`. It's nothing special.

# Installation
First off, make sure you have [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) installed. Next, install [vim-colors-solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized#installation). Back up your existing `~/.vimrc` if you have one. Then just run this command:

```curl -o ~/.vimrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeanPDX/vim-config/master/.vimrc```
